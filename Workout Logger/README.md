# Workout Logger

### Gym and Weightlifting Progress Tracker

This application allows you to track the exercises you have done in a workout session and save your workout once you are done logging

The application will be able to:
- save a list of exercises you have done in your workout
- show how many sets you have done for each exercise
- show how much weight you used and how many reps you have done in each set

This project will be used by me and anyone else who has an interest in lifting weights. This project is of interest to me because I believe a workout tracker is essential to anyone who lifts. I feel that being able to track your progress allows you to find what you are doing right or wrong and helps set realistic goals. By doing so, you end up with a workout routine that works better for you and are more likely to stay consistent. Plus, it is fun to look back at your past workouts and see how much progress you have made.

### Phase 4: Task 2

Workout has been started

Benchpress has been added to workout log

Set in position 1 with 245lbs used and 3 reps done has been added to Benchpress

Set in position 2 with 235lbs used and 5 reps done has been added to Benchpress

Set in position 2 with 235lbs used and 5 reps done has been removed from Benchpress

### Phase 4: Task 3

One thing I would change if I had more time would be to make Exercise an interface or abstract class and have it be implemented or extended by subclasses representing different types of exercise not limited to just weightlifting (cardio, calisthenics, etc.). That way, this application can be a lot more versatile and allows people to be able to fully track their workouts, since many people mix different types of exercises into their daily workouts.
